Nucleotide Sequence Alignment Tool
==================================

Overview
--------
This project implements a nucleotide sequence alignment tool using
the Smith–Waterman algorithm (Local Alignment) with affine gap penalties.

The program takes two FASTA files and a parameter file containing
scoring values (match, mismatch, gap opening, gap extension),
and outputs the best local alignment along with its alignment score.

Algorithm Implemented
---------------------
• Smith–Waterman (Local Alignment)
• Dynamic Programming approach
• Affine Gap Penalty Model

Affine gap penalty formula:

    Gap penalty = gap_open + (k - 1) * gap_extend

Where:
- gap_open = penalty for starting a new gap
- gap_extend = penalty for extending an existing gap
- k = length of the gap

Local alignment finds the highest scoring alignment region
between two sequences and does not force full-length alignment.

Input Files
-----------
1. seq1.fasta
2. seq2.fasta
3. parameters.txt

FASTA format example:

>Sequence_1
ATGCTAGCTAGGCTAACGTA

parameters.txt format:

match=2
mismatch=-1
gap_open=-5
gap_extend=-1

Usage
-----
Run the program using:

    python3 align.py seq1.fasta seq2.fasta parameters.txt

Output
------
The alignment result is written to:

    output.txt

Format of output.txt:

Best Alignment Score: <score>
<aligned_sequence_1>
<aligned_sequence_2>

Sequence Generation
-------------------
Test sequences were generated using a separate script:

    generate_sequences.py

Generation process:

1. A base DNA sequence of length 20 was generated randomly.
2. A fixed random seed was used to ensure reproducibility.
3. The second sequence was derived from the first by introducing:
   - 2 to 7 random substitutions (mutations)
   - 1 to 4 random deletions
   - 1 to 3 random insertions

This approach ensures:
- Realistic biological variation
- Presence of mismatches
- Presence of gaps
- A meaningful local alignment region

Using a fixed seed guarantees that the same sequences
are generated every time the script is run.

Testing and Verification
------------------------
Sequences can be tested using the EBI LALIGN tool:

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/lalign?stype=dna&gapext=0

To compare results:
- Use the same scoring parameters as in parameters.txt.
- Select DNA as molecule type.
